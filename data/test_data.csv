At this stage we planned for transoral odontoidectomy and posterior fixation of the occiput with the spinous processes of C2 –C3. *Chamberlain's line joins the hard palate to the posterior lip of the foramen magnum. Basilar impression is defined as being present when the tip of the dens projects more than 5 mm above Chamberlain's line.3 **Wachenheim clivus line (a method to evaluate and assess craniocervical junction abnormality/injury), a line drawn along the posterior aspect of the clivus toward the odontoid process. An abnormality is suspected when this line does not intersect and or / not tangential to the odontoid process.8

An asymmetrically enhancing mass lesion is seen in the sella turcia with extension to bilateral internal carotid artery. Patient 2's serum prolactin level was 183.7 ng/ml. The patient was treated with MASEP GKRS twice because of the huge volume of the mass. The second MASEP GKRS was performed 1 year after the first one. The tumor was treated separately with the lower and upper part in order to protect the optic chiasma. MRI was performed for treatment planning. 25 Gy defined to the 50% isodose line is used to cover the lower part of the pituitary tumor in the first treatment, and 18 Gy defined to the 50% isodose line is used to cover the upper part of the pituitary tumor in the second time.

An anechoic unilateral mild pleural effusion (PE) surrounds the lung lobes. (L: lateral; M: medial; Cd: caudal; Cr cranial.).

Three or more B-lines are called lung rockets, and are equivalent to interstitial syndrome.
